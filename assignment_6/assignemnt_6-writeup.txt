1. one of the articals that I read was about Chatbot sychosis. A condition that causes people who are vulnerable to psyciatric desises to become transfixed by Ai, this causes them to commit self harm, go long periods with out food, and has even resulted in people worshiping Ai like deity (no source was cited, so im not so sure about the last one).

2. I also watched a german production about people using chatbots as romatic partners and I had an intersting thought. There are certin benifits to being in Ai relationships for the short term. For one of the ladies in the documentery, Chat GPT was a confidant that helped her get through a hard time at work when other people in her life didn't have the bandwidth to help her. I do belive that for 99% of cases where a chat bot would be helpful, i think that a real connection would be better.

3. The last and probably most interesting thing that I learned over the course of todays assignemnt was that the difference between the models are shrinking. There is no longer a "best" model. They are becoming homogonized and their ability to reason and think is becoming more like each other
