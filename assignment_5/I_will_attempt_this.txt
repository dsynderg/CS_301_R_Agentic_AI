Great! Since I want to challenge the junior engineer beyond a simple JSON parser, I'll assign a task that involves multiple data manipulations, validations, and some processing logic. 

**New Assigned Task for the Junior Engineer:**

*Create a Python class `UserDataProcessor` that:*

- Accepts a list of user JSON strings during initialization.
- Parses all user data and validates that each user has a valid email, age (integer between 0 and 120), and name.
- Handles malformed JSON or missing fields gracefully, logging issues.
- Implements a method `get_average_age()` that calculates the average age of all valid users.
- Implements a method `get_country_user_counts()` assuming each user JSON has a "country" field, returning a dictionary with country names as keys and user counts as values.
- Implements a method `get_users_with_multiple_emails()` that, given a list of email addresses, returns users that have multiple email addresses (assuming the "email" field can be a list).

**This requires:**

- Advanced JSON parsing
- Validation logic
- Data aggregation
- Handling complex nested data
- Logging and error handling

---

### Junior Engineer's initial implementation (hypothetical)

*(In practice, I, as the junior engineer, will attempt to implement this.)*

---

### Thinking Process:

- Break down each part of the task.
- Handle malformed JSON with try/except, store errors.
- Validate required fields.
- Perform calculations and aggregations.
- Support multiple email addresses per user.

I'll proceed to work on this and then see how the senior engineer can critique and improve it. Would you like me to write the full code now?
