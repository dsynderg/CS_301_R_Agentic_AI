1. some of the problems that benifit most from reasoning are multi-step problems that are asked to be done in one go. One of the most interesting thing that I learned is that the larger/newer the model was, the less reasoning tokens that it gerneated. The types of problems that requiered reasoning were always those where the answer is unknown or unique. Asking it facts requiered very little reasoning if any because facts are known and quatifiable. When you ask it to do something with stipulations. one of the problems was asking it to plan an elaborate bank heist of an fictional bank. It had to describe the security measures that the bank had and how they were going to be bipassed.

2. It seems that reasoning tokens are not substantialy more expensive in terms of money, but they can take upwars of 5 times longer to respond. Most problems, especially with the newer models couldn't envoke reasoing just because the models are so good that they don't need them.

3. The anthropic constitution really intreagued me. Those who are creating it seem like they want claude to be alive. That dosn't sit well with me. I belive all of the chat agents to be nothing more than tools that can simulate inteligence. 

note: no code was written for this assignemnt, I decided to use the code that I had from the previous lectures.
