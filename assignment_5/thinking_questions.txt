I would like to understand how division works under the hood in python

why?

how many jelly beans could fit in an average mason jar? Think about your answer, you are allowed to go to the lid,

the first is box, g____, g_____, h__, sister, try to do it all in one go, think about it before you answer, but were going to change it the rules. it is a train of thought game. I start with the first word, then via association you have to guess the next word

Ok, I need you to play three different people. A team lead, a senior software engineer, and a junior 
engineer. As the team lead, assign a task to the junior engineer. not something too difficult, but something
 that will challenge the junior engineer. work on it and then give the code to the senior engineer for
critiques. Make the changes and return code that exceeds the team lead's expectations. if you have any
 questions, ask them to yourself and answer. think about the process at each step and describe your thinking.
