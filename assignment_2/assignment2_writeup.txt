1. The json was included in the prompt. The model was 
remarkably consistant at following the json once the items of the json were included
in the example. something interesting happned when there were instructions in the 
prompt that werent in the json. It would sometimes ignore them, and other times it 
it would include the instructions, so making sure that the two line up is crucial for good output

2. I gave the user the option to add not only contextual instructions but also CSV files.
the program will take in 5 entrys of the csv file and do what the context tells it to do.
It gives the user 5 csv entrys and jsonifys them and can even include info from its own 
training data. It is better because with the ability to add any csv, you can add any data set
and have it convert the listed items into json.

older models seem to work just as well as newer larger models, json is relitivly easy from 
a pandas data table.
