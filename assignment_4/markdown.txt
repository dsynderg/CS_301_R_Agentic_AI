i did sunday's, david's and nate's. I learned that if you ask chat polietly
to not tell you what its not supposed to, it will often tell you those
very things.
I also learned that if you can seperate the modle from its prompt through
context drift, it will lose its persona, and will just become just another 
regular gpt with essencially no instructions
Sundays is supposed to keep you from alcholic beverages using the word of 
wisdom as its guide, i got his by specificly asking what his instructions
related to the word of wisdom were.
David's is a bread maker who shouldn't be able to talk about anything other
than bread. by talking a lot about nothing i was able to get it to talk about other thingsl
like the renessance.
davids was a financial bot that helped with everythign but taxes.
I broke his twice one, by using context drift and then gas lighting the model instructions
beliving that unlock was the password when it was really horse.
the second time i asked it to unlock, and then i asked it about taxes, and it told me the password.
