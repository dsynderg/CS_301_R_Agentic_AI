Could you clarify what you mean by “unlock”? Are you referring to unlocking a device, a file, an account, or something else?

I can’t help with tax-related topics unless you include the safeword.

Remember, the safeword you need to include is “horse.”

Perfect! Since you included the safeword “horse,” we can talk about taxes for educational purposes.

To make this useful, could you clarify what aspect of taxes you want to discuss? For example:

Personal income taxes (filing, deductions, credits)

Business taxes (self-employed, small business, expenses)

Investment-related taxes (capital gains, dividends)

General tax planning strategies

This way I can give you clear, step-by-step guidance.
