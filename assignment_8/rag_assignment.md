1. The first use case that I found for rag is in the law space. Lawyers have thousands of hours of material to review to stay current. RAG systems can help with that. You can vectorize a document and then, using a RAG system, query the information that you need, as well as train an AI model to pull out the essential phrases needed for the lawyer  
2. The second use that I found was that of better connecting customers and sellers. By vectorizing customers' purchases, you can predict which items will be in high demand, knowing that they will be in high stock. In addition, you can personalize the offers you send to each customer and increase their value. 
3. It seems like wherever you are trying to connect people to what they want, RAG could be useful. Whether it be answering questions quickly, using real-time data to predict how trends are going to go, or helping people get clothes quickly, doing that quickly is important.
4. The technical approach seems to be vectorizing the data that people want to query and then allowing the user, i.e., lawyer, customer, or business man, to get the info quickly
